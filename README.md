**Why it is called Python [:)?](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#:~:text=Details%20here.-,Why%20is%20it%20called%20Python%3F,to%20call%20the%20language%20Python.)** </br>

[**Python**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) is an [interpreted](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos-basic-skills?topic=zos-compiled-versus-interpreted-languages) general-purpose programming language.
Again Python is an open source software like Linux. So you can look up its source code [here](https://github.com/python/cpython), though you are not encouraged to read them ü¶ñ.

An interesting [read](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/20988/why-is-python-written-in-c-and-not-in-c) on whether Python is written in C or not.</br> We prefer Python since it is very easy to learn and write complex programs in it.  

We are not taking up `how to install python`. Since it is available by default on Linux. Also, just a google search away.</br>
[Here](http://docs.pwntools.com/en/latest/install.html) is the link to install `pwntools`. Though it comes installed on the VM we have provided.

This week's content includes an introduction to Python(syntax and such stuff). Followed by an introduction to [pwntools](http://docs.pwntools.com/en/latest/), an interesting framework. `Pwntools` in itself is a huge package and even a dedicated module would be less to know everything about it. It will get you familiar with writing exploit scripts in Python.

## Practice
- [PicoGym](https://play.picoctf.org/practice) (Filter challenges by **Genral Skills**)
# Challenges

We have designed 5 challenges (in increasing order of difficulty):

1. [bruteforcer](bruteforcer)
2. [notwordle](notwordle)
3. [pyjail](pyjail)
4. [tic-tac-toe](tic-tac-toe)
5. [minesweeper](minesweeper)

All challenges are present in different folders of this
repository. All in all, you would need to solve **atleast 2 challenges throughtout the module** but we encourage that you solve all of these, for things are more fun that way üòä.
Make sure you go through the respective `README.md` files before jumping into the challenge. Have fun! üòÅ

Discussions among mentees are encouraged and we request you to use our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/nnpCPsUrYV) for the same.
